"""
Structured error envelope and exception types for tradingview-mcp.

All recoverable failures return a typed error envelope:

    {"error": {"code": "<CODE>", "message": "<human-readable>", **extras}}

Use :func:`make_error` to construct envelopes and :func:`is_error` to check
them. Service layers may also raise typed exceptions (e.g.
:class:`BatchExecutionError`) which the MCP tool wrapper layer converts to the
same envelope shape so MCP clients see a uniform error API.

Migration notes
---------------
- Tools that adopt this format return ``dict`` (the envelope) on error and
  their normal type on success — the static return type becomes a union.
- Callers must check ``isinstance(result, dict) and "error" in result``
  instead of substring-matching previous ``{"error": "Analysis failed: ..."}``
  strings.
- Adoption is opt-in per tool; see PR notes for the current opt-in set.
