"""Real-network stress tests — opt-in.

These tests hit live ``scanner.tradingview.com`` and Yahoo Finance. They
exist because the unit-test suite mocks every upstream call, and a regression
that lets calls hang indefinitely cannot be detected by mocks.

Run explicitly:

    pytest -m stress -v

Skipped by default in CI. Each test has a hard wall-clock ceiling — if any
test exceeds it the assertion fails, which is the whole point: we'd rather
ship a clear error than a "hang for 30 minutes" experience.

The ceilings are deliberately generous (90 s for batched scanners, 60 s for
multi-timeframe, 30 s for single-symbol calls) because the actual upstream
may be cliffing — in which case the fast-fail / wall-clock-budget guards in
``screener_service`` and ``scanner_service`` should kick in and return
either a partial result or a ``BatchExecutionError`` envelope. Either
counts as "did not hang".
